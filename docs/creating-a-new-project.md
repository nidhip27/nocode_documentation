Projects are a collection of pages. We offer unlimited projects and pages for free. Creating a new project with the Storylens Frontend tool is easy. In this short article, we'll create our first new project on Storylens.  

1. Make sure that you're logged in to Storylens. If you don't have an account, create one now.

2. Head to the Storylens dashboard. The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of everything we offer. 

3. Add a new Project. Click on the Add new button on the top right corner. 

4. Give your project a name. It can be anything.

5. You will see the list of pages in the project. We've already created a page titled Home. You can add additional projects by clicking the button on the top right corner.

6. Hover over a page to edit, preview, or delete a page. Editing a page should take you to the Storylens Frontend tool.
