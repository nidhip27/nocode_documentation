title: Adding a New Page
---
As your project grows, you may need to add more pages. All the pages in a particular project can share all the saved components amongst them. Our dashboard helps you accomplish this quickly and efficiently. Here is a step-by-step walk-through of the process.


1. We start by navigating to the dashboard after you have logged in to your storylens.io account.

2. On the website builder page, you will see the option to "Add a New Page" or choose from a set of templates.

You will also see a snapshot of your existing pages. If you want to edit or delete an existing page, hover your mouse over the desired page and choose the relevant option among those that pop up.

3. Let us start with adding a new page. To start, click the "+ Add New Page" button as indicated above. This will lead to a pop-up where you can name your new page.

4. Once done, you can click "Create". You can always go back and edit the page as and when required.
  
As you name your page, you will notice that a URL for the page is auto-populated.

5. You should now be able to see your newly created page as a blank canvas.

To edit this (or other existing pages) you can click on the edit button. For details on how to use the Website Builder efficiently, please refer to the help article here.
