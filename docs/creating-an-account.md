2. We recommend signing up with Google/ Facebook buttons for ease of use.

3. You'll be prompted to log in to Google and Facebook respectively. Once logged in, you will be asked whether you'd like to permit us to access the data. This data usually includes an access token, name, email address, and profile picture. 
  
4. Once confirmed, the browser will redirect you to our dashboard at app.storylens.io
