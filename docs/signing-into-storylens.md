Here's the simple tutorial on signing into your account. 

1. Start by click on the ‘Sign In’ option on the top of your page. You can also directly access the page by going to storylens.io/login.

2. Storylens provides you with two options to log in, you can either sign in using the email address and password at the time of account creation, or you can log in using your Facebook/Google account. 

3. If your email is verified, the browser will redirect you to the Storylens Dashboard. If not, you will be asked to verify your email address. Press the resend email button. 

4. After you press the Resend button, you will receive an email with a One-Time Password (OTP). It might take a couple of minutes for the OTP to show up. Check the spam folder if you are unable to see the mail in your inbox.

5. Type in the OTP that you received into the input field.

 6. Once confirmed, the browser will redirect you to our dashboard at app.storylens.io
